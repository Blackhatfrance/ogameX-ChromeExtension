This channel is to share the latest versions of my google chrome extension and discuss new features. You are welcome to request features. I will try to realize them as long as those are possible and fair! The extension will not cover any kind of bot-like automation!!!
You are also welcome to report bugs here

I am always sharing my extension as a zip file. To use it you have to do the following things:

- Use google chrome :nerd: 
- Go to the extensions page (chrome://extensions) and activate developers mode (top right corner)
- Option 1: Just drag and drop the zipped extension into the extension window
- Option 2: unzip the extension. Open contentscript.js and modify the options if you don´t like to use all the features. Then drag and drop the whole folder into the extension window. Or use "Load unpacked extension"

Don´t be afraid that I steal any of your data or account info. Nothing like that will happen. All of my code is open source since I am sharing the zip file. You can check on your own what the code is doing before using it. Or ask a friend who understands codes :wink:

@everyone 

Changelog AddoneX V0.0.0.2:
-Added the planetlist feature: Planets are now listed in two columns.
-Added player rank feature in the galaxy view: The player rank is now visible in the galaxy. You don´t have to look at the tooltip
